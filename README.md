# CRIMENET: Global Crime Intelligence Engine

## Project Overview

CRIMENET is an advanced analytical platform designed for global crime intelligence extraction and analysis. This research-driven system integrates cutting-edge natural language processing, machine learning, and database technologies to process crime-related information from diverse sources. The platform enables law enforcement agencies, researchers, and policy analysts to identify patterns, predict trends, and derive actionable insights from global crime data.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Acquisition Pipeline
- **Regional Scraping Modules**: Specialized collectors for global crime news across five regions:
  - European news sources
  - North American coverage
  - South American reports
  - Oceania crime data
  - International news agencies
- **Title Classification System**: Machine learning models to identify crime-related content from news titles

### 2. Natural Language Processing Engine
- **Article Deduplication**: NLP models evaluating similarity scores to eliminate redundant reports
- **Information Extraction**: LLM-powered extraction of structured crime data entities and relationships
- **Semantic Analysis**: Vector embeddings for contextual understanding of crime narratives

### 3. Data Processing Framework
- **Structured Schema Design**: Comprehensive data model for crime entity relationships
- **Transformation Pipeline**: Conversion of unstructured text to standardized formats
- **MySQL Implementation**: Optimized relational database for crime data storage

### 4. Intelligence Analytics Module
- **Temporal Trend Analysis**: Time-series examination of crime patterns
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning for crime prediction and follow-up recommendations
- **Semantic Query Interface**: Natural language search across structured and unstructured data

### 5. Model Evaluation System
- **LLM Benchmarking**: Comparative analysis of language models for crime analytics tasks
- **Performance Metrics**: Standardized evaluation framework for extraction and prediction accuracy
